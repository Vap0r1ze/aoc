# Advent of Code 2022

I will use different languages each day, and I will try my best to use real langauges

Other people with cool AoC repos:
  - [dzshn's](https://github.com/dzshn/aoc2022)
  - [ven's](https://github.com/Vendicated/AOC22/)
  - [manti's](https://github.com/mantikafasi/advent-of-code-2022)

Most if not all of the programs take input from `stdin` and output to `stdout`

# History

- Day 1: Bash Shell ([part 1](day/part1.sh), [part 2](01/part2.sh))

  I kinda cheated and used some Unix utilities lol

- Day 2: [GolfScript](http://www.golfscript.com/golfscript/) ([part 1](02/part1.gs), [part 2](02/part2.gs))

  This language is so cool!! Shoutout to [dzshn](https://github.com/dzshn) for blessing me :)

- Day 4: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) ([part 1](04/part1.gpt), [part 2](04/part2.gpt))

  Trolled

- Day 9: [Python](https://www.python.org/) ([part 1](09/part1.py), [part 2](09/part2.py))

  When I saw today way very coordinate heavy I wanted to use a language that had a complex number builtin, but I didnt wanna waste a cool one like [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) or [Julia](https://julialang.org/) yet
